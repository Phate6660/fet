This repo will contain the sources of an assortment of random programs written in [Fetlang](https://github.com/fetlang/fetlang).

Don't expect anything in this repo to be serious, and given the nature of Fetlang<br>
expect anything and everything in this repo to be NSFW.<br><br>

Files of note:<br>
\- emacs: contains WIP syntax highlighting via fetlang-mode<br>
\- math.fet: testing out some math as the name suggests<br>
\- syntax-highlighting-test.fet: the file I will be using to test out the syntax highlighting as I make it<br>
\- test: shell script to build and run progams, usage: `./test blah.fet`
